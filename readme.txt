This is a embedded project based on STM32 and FreeRTOS, the system realizes the collection and monitoring of indoor temperature and humidity, and it also can implement more functions.

The project realizes the room temperature monitoring system based on STM32 and FreeRTOS, realizes the real-time detection of indoor temperature and humidity, and displays the system interface and real-time temperature and humidity information through the LCD screen. When the detected temperature and humidity are not within the set monitoring range,
the buzzer alarms and the LCD displays the alarm information. The system design includes hardware design and software design. The system hardware design uses STM32 as the core to build a hardware platform, and the system software design is based on STM32 firmware library version 3.5 and FreeRTOS kernel design software program.
